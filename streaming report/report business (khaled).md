1. The results has been calculated by acquiring the results of **30** similar matches and comparing the team probability of winning with the team prediction. We calculated the number of correct guesses over the total number for each team to see the performance of the three heuristics.

2. As it can be seen The Accuracy o heuristic **2** reaches over **60%** accuracy.

3. It's noted that the accuracy of blue is always less than the red team with a big margin. Maybe the game meant to do that to make the opposing team always a little bit challenging to the current team, but further investigation with bigger data needs to be made.

4. This problem is challenging because Mostly the game tries to balance the teams level not to make it boring for both of them and keep it always interesting.
